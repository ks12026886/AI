<H3><u>History:</u></h3><p>The beginnings of modern AI can be traced to classical philosophers' attempts to describe human thinking as a symbolic system. But the field of AI wasn't formally founded until 1956, at a conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined.</p>

<div id="nlp"><h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
<p id="leg">Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-base.

<div id="cv"><h3>Computer Vision</h3>
<p id="rn">Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.
</p></div>
<div id="ds"><h3>Data Science</h3>
<p id="ae">Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning, big data, computational statistics and analytics.

<u>Future Scope:</u></h3>
<p>Another area where the future scope of AI is quite broad is driverless cars. Many companies are developing autonomous vehicles, which will rely heavily on AI and ML to operate optimally. Experts believe self-driving cars will bring many long-term and short-term benefits, including lower emissions and enhanced road safety.</p>
