<p>Machine Learning:Machine learning is the technique to achieve A.I. Machine learning provides a machine with the capability to learn from data and experience through algorithms. The complex way of compiling computer programing codes is not the same as machine learning. In machine learning, robots are able to learn different things and languages without adding blocks of computer codes to do it.
<br>
• Deep learning:Deep learning is a subset of machines learning. Robots are able to study the environment and make choices with recognition senses without update of programming software. Deep learning is attributed to the development of data inputs in artificial intelligence and robot learn the behavior of other robots by storing moments records in memory.
<br>
• Robotics:Robotics is a defined way of using a robot to develop another robot system with AI tools. Robots are built for the purpose of creating another robots for a different task,the building blocks of robotics comprises with all the domains of artificial intelligence. The software components, the hardware components and the inclusion of internet of things ideologies makes a robot work perfectly.
<br>
• Fuzzy Logic:AI robots are able to execute the coded logics and output one true or false statement or action. Robot are able to know the direction to turn at a specific condition or situation and these are possible because fuzzy logics is a function in artificial intelligence. That common sense of identifying an object differences and choose one is also a logical reasoning.
<br>
• Natural Language Processing:The natural language processing is a major instrument in artificial intelligence where robot machines are able to understand multiple languages of human. This facilitate easy language translation between robots and human. Robots store’s languages into memory and recall its meaningful understanding logics to act on a word or speech.
