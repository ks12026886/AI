<p><h4>Artificial Intelligence Research</h4>
Although many of these top careers explore the application or function of AI technology, computer science and artificial intelligence research is more about discovering ways to advance the technology itself. “There will always be somebody developing a faster machine,” Edmunds says. “There’s always going to be somebody pushing the edge, and that [person] will be a computer scientist.”</p>
<p><h4>Software Engineering</h4>
The AI field also relies on traditional computer science roles such as software engineers to develop the programs on which artificial intelligence tools function.</p>
<p><h4>Natural Language Processing</h4>
Many of the most popular consumer applications of AI today revolve around language. From chatbots to virtual assistants to predictive texting on smartphones, AI tools have been used to replicate human speech in a variety of formats. To do this effectively, developers call upon the knowledge of natural language processers—individuals who have both the language and technology skills needed to assist in the creation of these tools. “Natural language processing is applying machine learning to language,” Edmunds says. “It’s a really big field.”</p>
<p><h4>Data Analytics</h4>
With data at the heart of AI and machine learning functions, those who have been trained to properly manage that data have many opportunities for success in the industry. Though data science is a broad field, Edmunds emphasizes the role that data analysts play in these AI processes as one of the most significant.</p>
